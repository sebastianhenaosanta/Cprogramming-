/*
You are developing an elixir that supposedly makes a person younger. 
You just need to get the software working correctly before starting to market your product. 
Your program keeps track of a person's age, but in order to be more secretive you work with a 
pointer rather than the variable that stores the age directly. 

You are provided with a main function -- please complete it. 
Do not change any of the lines of code that have already been completed. 
Please only change the lines that are currently comments.
